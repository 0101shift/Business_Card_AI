Business card design on a PCB, isn't it crazy!!? An eye catching design fusing electronics with a bit astronomy comes out really well. And the card is also integrated with NFC tag which links to my portfolio whenever tapped. With the energy harvesting feature, NFC IC generates enough power to light up the LED circuit on the card.
